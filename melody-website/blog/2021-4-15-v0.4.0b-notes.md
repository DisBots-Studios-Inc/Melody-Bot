Hello There! This is the notes for the v0.4.0b of **Melody-Bot**!
This is **NOT** the release notes!!! Just features planned. With that being said,
Let's jump into the features to be expected in this major release:

:::tip Not all of these features will make it into the release!
:::

```
1. Proper Youtube API impl.
2. Proper youtube music search support.
3. Travis CI support
4. Unit Testing support.
5. Use google's "Guava" package to simplify code.
6. Better directory structure.
7. Database support. (probably won't make it to final!)
```

Thanks for taking the time to read this post! We really appreciate it.

Hope to see you in the full release! :slight_smile:
